## Description
Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat, the app will then display the burger on the page. Each burger has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app stores every burger in a database.

Here is the code that will call the ORM functions using burger specific input for the ORM. While there are NPM packages like Sequelize that make writing all of this out unecessary, it is important to understand what is going on "underneath the hood" so this is a vital section of code.

## Take Away
While seemingly simple, this app is actually very tricky. The main take away for me is understanding that you can use extensions such as Handlebars or SEquelize to maybe make your code drier and simpler, but that can betray you if you don't actually understand what they are doing or know how to do the same work with out the help.
